# Euler-Poisson-or-Gaussian-Integral-Solutions

Here are numerical solutions to the infamous analytically unsolvable Euler-Poisson/Gaussian integral without the use of the error function. This is executed by employing both the composite Simpson's numerical integration method and the adaptive Simpson's numerical integration method.

The Euler-Poisson integral has *NO* such elementary indefinite integral,i.e., *NO* existent antiderivative without defined boundaries.

"This integral has a wide range of applications. For example, with a slight change of variables it is used to compute the normalizing constant of the normal distribution. The same integral with finite limits is closely related both to the error function and the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. In physics this type of integral appears frequently, for example, in quantum mechanics, to find the probability density of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator, also in the path integral formulation, and to find the propagator of the harmonic oscillator, we make use of this integral." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral
